And the people went into the high hill, oh-ey
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why.
Winter came, and made it all look alike, look a lie.
Underneath the grass would grow aiming at the sky

It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing art all would go for the kill
