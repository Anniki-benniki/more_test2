And the people went into the high hill, oh-ey
From the start they didn't know exactly why, why.
Winter came, and made it all look alike, look a lie.
Underneath the grass would grow aiming at the sky

It was swift, it was just another wave of a miracle
But no one, nothing at all would go for the kill
If they called on every soul in the land, on the moon,
Only then would they know the blessing in disguise.
